Having a brain capacity similar to those of chimps, they were not thought to be highly intelligent. However, they did walk on two legs, just like us! Recent fossil findings also have  revealed that they used stone tools. These weapons would eventually evolve to the axes of their future descendants."

Modern humans in Eastern Europe and Asia carry Denisovan DNA today. It is hypothesized that their genes might help some populations modern humans in Tibet live in high altitudes."

Meat was a regular part of their diet, and they were confirmed to not only use stone tools, but also craft them. It is most likely that the discovery of fire began with this species. Surviving for over 1 million years, they were, by far, the most successful species of humans to have ever lived. Their remains can be found in all through Africa, Asia, Europe, and even the distant islands of South-East Asia."

            info: "Homo Ergaster, originally thought to be its own species, was an African breed of Homo Erectus. They crafted stone tools and axes and likely used fire in their daily lives to hunt and defend the territories. They were the apex predators of their time in their environment. It is likely that, by this point, they had the ability to sweat like us modern humans. This would provide them with the ability to cool off in the sun's heat and regenerate stamina while running. This is what makes humans the best marathon runners on the planet."

            info: `The Homo Floresiensis was a mysterious species of human whose fossils were foundo on the island of Flores in Indonesia. They much smaller than the rest of the humans, and even their brains had shrunk from their previous stages of evolution. Despite this phenomenon, the tools found with their fossils were still advanced and highly sophisticated. Their reduction in physical size was an effect of what is known as "Island Dwarfism".`

            info: `Homo Habilis was, during its dicovery, the oldest known human ancestor to use stone tools. This is what earned it the title of "Homo", meaning "human". It is unclear whether or not they craft their own tools, or used what they found. Their brains were significantly larger than those of their earlier Australopithicene ancestors and they may have also hunted together in groups.`

Compared to our direct ancestors, Heidelbergensis were bigger and stronger. They were likely even more intelligent, as their brain capacity was higher. However, there are signs that this species practiced cannibalism. This may have led to their downfall."

However, their physical characteristics are baffling in that the size of their brains were very primitive. Their hands were curved, built for climbing trees, yet very nimble like ours. There may even be evidence they suggests that they buried their dead members. Not much is yet known about this species, as it is a very new find. In time, hopefully we can uncover more about these mysterious cousins of ours."

            info: `Our cousins, the Neanderthals, were very much like us. They crafted spears, jewelry, clothing, and may have even practiced religion. Although pure-blooded Neanderthals are no longer alive today, a majority of the world's population carries their DNA. They lived in Europe up until the Ice Age. It was during that time that Homo Sapiens also arrived in Europe and met the Neanderthals. Not much is known about what happened, but we know for certain that interbreeding has occured.`

Although there isn't much archaeological evidence to further inspect their behavior, they would have most likely lived and behaved like their Heidelbergensis ancestors. They made stone tools, lived in family groups, and were the dominant predators in their environment."

            info: "The earliest Homo Sapiens evolved in Africa, from a breed of Homo Erectus. These people were more slender-bodied and highly intelligent. A slim build was very efficient in reducing body heat in the sun. In addition to this cooling system and a large brain, they had another unique anatomical breakthrough: their flexible shoulder joints. Humans are the best throwers on the planet, and it all comes from this unique Sapien characteristic. A much greater range of motion provides greater throwing power, at the cost of high risk of shoulder injury."

They were roughly similar in intelligence to their Australopithecene relatives, with their main differences between in their physical appearance. As suggested by the name, their remains were found in Kenya and estimated to be approximately 3 million to 3.5 million years old."

It is unclear if modern humans carry admixture from them, due to their fossils being too old for DNA extraction. They were one of the many breeds that Homo Erectus had diverged into, due to their highly successful evolutionary breakthrough."

Their fossils were found in the Yunnan Province of China, in the Longlin Cave (Red Deer Cave). They were an archaic population, showing traits exhibited by the earlier versions of Homo Erectus and even Homo Habilis. It is unclear what led to their extinction, but modern humans most likely may have played a part in it."
